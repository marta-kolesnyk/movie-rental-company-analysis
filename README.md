# Rockbuster Stealth: Movies and Market Analysis
## Overview:
The project focused on Rockbuster Stealth - a fictional movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. 
The Rockbuster Stealth management team was planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. 

## Objective: 
The project goal was to determine the most profitable movies and regions that should be prioritized when switching to the online platform.

## Data:
Rockbuster Stealth database contains information about the companyâ€™s movie inventory, customers, payments, and local stores.
The database has a snowflake schema, where dimension table is linked to other sub dimension tables that contain relational information.
It consists of 4 fact tables and 11 dimension tables. 

I used PostgreSQL to work with the database. 

## Analysis Phase:
- Used Lucidchart application to extract Entity Relationshp Diagram (ERD) to find out the database structure
- Documented information about each table in a Data Dictionary (specified the columns type and description, marked primary and secondary keys)
- Wrote cost-effective queries to group and order the data using functions such as GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT , as well as aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)
