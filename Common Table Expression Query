Here is a SQL query with common table expression. 
It looks for top-300 movies by revenue, with rating, genre and revenue percentage.

WITH base AS (
SELECT D.film_id, D.title AS movie_name, F.name AS genre, 
       D. rating, SUM(A.amount) AS revenue
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
INNER JOIN inventory C ON B.inventory_id = C.inventory_id
INNER JOIN film D ON C.film_id = D.film_id
INNER JOIN film_category E ON D.film_id = E.film_id
INNER JOIN category F ON E.category_id = F.category_id
GROUP BY D.film_id, D.title, F.name, D.rating
ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
),
total AS (
SELECT SUM (amount) AS total_revenue
FROM payment)
SELECT base.movie_name, base.genre, base.rating, base.revenue,
	   total.total_revenue,
	   CAST(base.revenue AS FLOAT)/total.total_revenue*100 AS movie_revenue_percentage
FROM base, total
ORDER BY base.revenue DESC
LIMIT 300;
